# Example Project Setup

This repository can be cloned and used as the basis for project 1 in IN5310/IN9310.

The `main` branch should contain the code for the main deliverables.  You are encouraged to use a branching model that works for your team, with the restriction that **stable** and working version of the code should be maintained in this branch.

## Report

For the report files, you should put all the files related to them into the `report` branch.  See the [`README.md`](../report/README.md) in that branch for more information on its setup.
